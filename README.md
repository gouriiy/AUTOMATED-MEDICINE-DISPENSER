## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Together with a team of members, I completed my S6 Miniproject - AUTOMATED MEDICINE DISPENSER.
It is a microcontroller based project focusing on health-care automation.
Our project consists of an ESP8266 board, stepper motor and its driver module, IR sesnsor to sense medicine dispensing.
We also used Blynk App as an IoT platform to automate the dispensing. Blynk App is mainly used to notify the user about the dispensing and to monitor the dispenser's action.
